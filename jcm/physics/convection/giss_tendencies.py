"""GISS convective environmental tendencies from the plume mass flux.

The convective plume's effect on the *environment* -- the ``dq_mc``/``dth_mc``
tendencies -- comes from **compensating subsidence**: by mass continuity, the
mass the plume carries up must sink in the surrounding environment, advecting the
environmental profile and warming/drying it. ``MSTCNV`` implements this as an
**upwind advection** of the mass-weighted environmental quantities by the
convective mass flux (``apply_continuity_tendencies`` / the subsidence loop).

This module ports that upwind operator. It takes a convective mass flux at the
interior interfaces and an environmental profile, and returns the per-layer
tendency from compensating subsidence.

Scope / status
--------------
This is the tendency *operator* (the mechanism). Producing the actual
``dq_mc``/``dth_mc`` still needs the convective mass-flux profile assembled from
the plume(s) (cloud-base closure magnitude + entrainment/detrainment continuity)
and the detrainment deposition added -- those are the remaining ports. The
single-step upwind here omits ``MSTCNV``'s CFL substepping (valid while the mass
flux is below the layer mass each step, as in shallow convection).

Sign convention follows ``MSTCNV``'s ``cmn``: a **positive** interface flux
advects the layer *below* the interface upward; negative advects the layer above
downward. Broadcasting-native: vertical on axis 0.

    """Per-layer tendency of ``prop`` from compensating-subsidence advection.

    Faithful single-step port of the ``MSTCNV`` subsidence upwind flux: across
    each interior interface the mass flux carries the *upwind* (donor) layer's
    property; the per-layer change is the flux convergence, divided by the layer
    mass to give an intensive tendency.

    Args:
        interface_flux: Convective mass flux [kg/m²] at the ``n-1`` interior
            interfaces, ``(n-1, ...)``, ordered like the layers (interface ``i``
            sits between layers ``i`` and ``i+1``). Positive advects the lower
            layer up (``MSTCNV`` ``cmn`` sign).
        prop: Intensive environmental property per layer, ``(n, ...)`` (e.g.
            potential temperature, dry static energy, or specific humidity).
        layer_mass: Layer air mass ``MA = dp/g`` [kg/m²], ``(n, ...)``.

    Returns:
        Per-layer change in ``prop`` over the step (same units as ``prop``),
        ``(n, ...)``. The mass-weighted column total is zero (pure internal
        advection conserves the property).
